  Review                   = {Conclusion Thermo-Calc is today an established tool for calculating thermodynamic properties and phase-equilibria in materials. Over the last years the software has been made more accessible.

The development of a windows version, TCW, enables materials & process engineers to perform advanced calculations in an easy and intuitive way.
The amount of available high quality thermodynamic data is continuously increasing and thermodynamic databases for new applications e.g. environmental issues can now be used in Thermo-Calc.
Programming interfaces allows Thermo-Calc to be used as part of another software providing thermodynamic and equilibrium data as a subroutine.
All this has made Thenno-Calc into a whole set of tools with multiple applicability in science and industry.
DICTRA has proven itself to be capable of simulating the rate of phase transformations and diffusion processes in multicomponent alloys. The unique feature of DICTRA is the implementation of several phase transformation mode models that adds microstructural information or constraints and local equilibrium constraints to the diffusional flux calculations. The application of DICTRA to many well known processes such as sintering, heat treatment or surface treatments has provided new insights both from a scentifical and industrial point of view.}

  Abstract                 = { The reaction of ammonia decomposition and nitriding reaction as an example of the parallel reactions were studied. A surface reaction was assumed as the rate limiting step. The experiments were carried out in the range of temperatures from 623 to 723 K. Mixtures of different iron nitrides (γ′-Fe4N, ϵ-Fe3−2N) were obtained. Differential tubular reactor with thermogravimetric (TG) measurement and analysis of the gas phase composition in the reaction volume was used. Reacting gases flowing through the reactor were mixed. Effective reactor volume was determined. The rate constants for ammonia decomposition and ammonia adsorption process at critical point between α-Fe and γ′-Fe4N phases were estimated. The number of collisions and the sticking coefficient of ammonia over α-Fe phase were also assessed. },

  Abstract                 = {Pyrocarbon deposition from methane was studied at ambient pressure and a temperature of 1100 °C using a vertical hot-wall reactor with a honeycomb structure as substrate. Compared to the deposition tube used in previous studies this substrate exhibits a 15-fold increase in surface area. The methane initial partial pressure was varied up to 75 kPa, and the residence time up to 1 second. The results are compared with those obtained with the tube. The surface area is shown to decisively influence the chemistry and kinetics of deposition reactions and thus also the major growth species of pyrocarbon. With residence time increasing from zero to one second the ratio of surface-related pyrocarbon deposition rates obtained with tube and honeycomb structure vary by a factor of about 18. With increasing initial partial pressure, deposition rates tend to approach a limiting value indicating saturation adsorption. Pyrocarbon deposition rates as a function of residence time and initial partial pressure have been simulated considering complex homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions.},

An isothermal section of the phase diagram at 1000{\textdegree}C is shown. Lattice dimensions of the three carbides were determined for several values of the ratio Cr:(Fe +Cr). The solubilities of the carbides at each temperature were determined by metallographic study of quenched specimens. The distribution of Cr between austenite ($\gamma$) and the several carbides was determined by use of the electron microprobe. Data of Wada et al on the activity of carbon were used to calculate activities at the y-phase boundary and the free energy of the several carbides as a function of their chromium content. The data are treated thermodynamically on the basis of assumed random mixing of Cr and Fe atoms in each carbide. While this randomness was not definitely proved, the assumption was shown to be reasonable and the results useful. Extrapolation to 0 and 100 pct Cr gives values for the standard free energy of Cr7C3 and the hypothetical carbides Cr36C, and Fe7C3.},

  Abstract                 = { Recent trends in hydrocarbon fuel research indicate that the number of species and reactions in chemical kinetic mechanisms is rapidly increasing in an effort to provide predictive capabilities for fuels of practical interest. In order to cope with the computational cost associated with the time integration of stiff, large chemical systems, a novel approach is proposed. The approach combines an exponential integrator and Krylov subspace approximations to the exponential function of the Jacobian matrix. The components of the approach are described in detail and applied to the ignition of stoichiometric methane–air and iso-octane–air mixtures, here described by two widely adopted chemical kinetic mechanisms. The approach is found to be robust even at relatively large time steps and the global error displays a nominal third-order convergence. The performance of the approach is improved by utilising an adaptive algorithm for the selection of the Krylov subspace size, which guarantees an approximation to the matrix exponential within user-defined error tolerance. The Krylov projection of the Jacobian matrix onto a low-dimensional space is interpreted as a local model reduction with a well-defined error control strategy. Finally, the performance of the approach is discussed with regard to the optimal selection of the parameters governing the accuracy of its individual components. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The effect on the bainitic transformation of carburizing, nitriding and carbonitriding of a 23MnCrMo5 low-alloyed steel in the austenitic field was examined by in situ high-energy synchrotron X-ray diffraction (HEXRD) and transmission electron microscopy. CrN nitrides precipitated in austenite during the enrichment in nitrogen and were quantified. Enrichment in nitrogen leads to a fine bainitic ferrite microstructure, which contains the CrN nitrides as well as some AlN, \{VN\} and MnSiN2 precipitates, with much smaller number density. The precipitates are frequently gathered into aggregates. By using HEXRD, it was possible to monitor ferrite, austenite, cementite and CrN mass fraction during the isothermal bainitic transformation, whereas \{HEXRD\} experiments in previous studies focused mostly on carbide-free bainite. Ferrite formed first, followed by cementite precipitation and, in the case of nitrided steels, increase of CrN mass fraction. Enrichment in carbon and/or nitrogen tends to slow down the bainitic transformation compared to the initial steel, as expected from their austenite-stabilizing character. However, comparison between enriched steels shows that kinetics is not simply related to the total interstitial content when both carbon and nitrogen are simultaneously involved. Possible role of CrN precipitated in austenite on ferrite formation acceleration is discussed.},

The combined effects of carbon and nitrogen are here studied by working with homogenous samples with different contents. A process, based on thermodynamic study, has been set up to enrich dilatometric samples in N and/or C by gas carbonitriding at 900°C in order to get a controlled and homogeneous concentration over the wall thickness of the samples. Global isothermal phase transformation kinetics have been studied by dilatometry as a function of C/N enrichment. As expected, an increase in the C concentration leads to slower transformation kinetics. In the nitrogen enriched samples, it seems that the chromium nitrides formed at high temperature have an influence on the nucleation of the phases during cooling. Bainitic transformation at 400°C was studied by synchrotron diffraction and it was found that for all of the compositions, ferrite form first and then the precipitation occurs. For carbon enriched specimen, cementite precipitates. For nitrogen enriched specimen, chromium nitrides precipitate as well as cementite.},

Both processes are rate-controlled by the volume diffusion of nitrogen atoms in the mar- tensite. The segregation leads to a volume contrac- tion, whereas ordering occurs without apparent length change.

Conversion of intermediate a" nitride into T' nitride above 220 ~ This process causes a hardness reduc- tion (about 150 HV0.~ for 4.6 at. pct N) and a large length decrease.

Martensitic specimens were prepared by gaseous nitriding of pure iron in a mixture of NH 3 and H2, followed by quenching in brine and subsequently in liquid nitrogen. The aging process can be divided into two stages. First, a redistribution of nitrogen atoms in the martensite matrix occurs (aging time < about 40 hours) in three ways: segregation of nitrogen to lattice defects (about 0.07N/100Fe), transfer of a small amount of nitrogen (about 0.06N/100Fe) from a/b- to c-type octahedral interstices, and local enrichment in an ordered way of the majority of the nitrogen atoms (coherent ot"-Fel6N2 precipitates). Sec- ond, formation of incoherent a"-Fe~6N2takes place (aging time > about 40 hours).

About 0.07N/100Fe segregates at lattice defects in the iron-nitrogen martensite (5.8N/100Fe), as deduced from the decrease of the unit cell volume. 2. In addition, about 0.06N/100Fe transfers from a/b-type octahedral interstices to c-type inter- stices, as deduced from the decrease of the a lat- tice parameter: not all nitrogen atoms are in c-type octahedral interstices in as-prepared martensite. The observation of a constant c lattice parameter is quantitatively consistent with the combined ef- fects of segregation and transfer. The (unit cell) volume change by the transfer process is virtually nil. 3. The dominant part of the nitrogen atoms is in- volved in the development of local enrichments of nitrogen while maintaining the coherency with the solvent (iron) lattice. Such regions can be conceived as coherent o~"-Fel6N2 precipitates, al- though the present X-ray diffraction experiment is not sensitive enough to detect the extremely weak {002}~,,/{200}~,, "superstructure" reflection. This redistribution of nitrogen atoms over c-type octahedral interstices changes, in particular, the mean square of the static displacements of the iron atoms in the direction of the c lattice parameter, leading to about 18 pct reduction of the inte- grated intensity of the {002}~, reflection, while the mean static displacement and, thus, the (unit cell) volume are constant. B. Formation of incoherent o~"-Fel6N2at room temper- ature (aging times > about 40 hours): 4. On prolonged aging, new reflections appear in the diffraction pattern, which can be indexed as {004},~ and {224},~ Their emergence implies that regions in the matrix containing the ordered arrangement of nitrogen atoms diffract independently from the matrix. 5. The decrease of integrated intensity for the {002},, reflection and the increase of integrated intensity for the {004}~. reflection are quantitatively con- sistent with the local decomposition of martensite into a" and a.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The relative importance index (RII) method for determining appropriate target species for dynamic adaptive chemistry (DAC) simulations using the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method is developed. The adequacy and effectiveness of this \{RII\} method is validated for two fuels: n-heptane and isopentanol, representatives of a ground transportation fuel component and bio-alcohol, respectively. The conventional method of \{DRGEP\} target species selection involves picking an unchanging (static) set of target species based on the combustion processes of interest; however, these static target species may not remain important throughout the entire combustion simulation, adversely affecting the accuracy of the method. In particular, this behavior may significantly reduce the accuracy of the DRGEP-based \{DAC\} approach in complex multidimensional simulations where the encountered combustion conditions cannot be known a priori with high certainty. Moreover, testing multiple sets of static target species to ensure the accuracy of the method is generally computationally prohibitive. Instead, the \{RII\} method determines appropriate \{DRGEP\} target species solely from the local thermo-chemical state of the simulation, ensuring that accuracy will be maintained. Further, the \{RII\} method reduces the expertise required of users to select \{DRGEP\} target species sets appropriate to the combustion phenomena under consideration. Constant volume autoignition simulations run over a wide range of initial conditions using detailed reaction mechanisms for n-heptane and isopentanol show that the \{RII\} method is able to maintain accuracy even when traditional static target species sets fail, and are even more accurate than expert-selected target species sets. Additionally, the accuracy and efficiency of the \{RII\} method are compared to those of static target species sets in single-cell engine simulations under homogeneous charge compression ignition conditions. For simulations using more stringent \{DRGEP\} thresholds, the \{RII\} method performs similarly to that of the static target species sets. With a larger \{DRGEP\} threshold, the \{RII\} method is significantly more accurate than the static target species sets without imposing significant computational overhead. Furthermore, the applicability of the \{RII\} method to a DRG-based \{DAC\} scheme is discussed. },

The concentrations of a chemical system evolve in time according to the differential law of mass action kinetics. A computer simulation requires the implementation of the differential system and its numerical integration in time. \{KPP\} translates a specification of the chemical mechanism into fortran or c simulation code that implement the concentration time derivative function and its Jacobian, together with a suitable numerical integration scheme. Sparsity in Jacobian is carefully exploited in order to obtain computational efficiency. \{KPP\} incorporates a library with several widely used atmospheric chemistry mechanisms and users can add their own chemical mechanisms to the library. \{KPP\} also includes a comprehensive suite of stiff numerical integrators. The \{KPP\} development environment is designed in a modular fashion and allows for rapid prototyping of new chemical kinetic schemes as well as new numerical integration methods. },

Published data on thermochemical properties and phase equilibria have been critically examined and used to optimise the model parameters. The Fe–Mn–C system has been evaluated previously by Huang [W. Huang, Metall. Trans. A 21A (1990) 2115–2123]. In comparison to that evaluation, experimental liquidus data are now considerably better described and carbide equilibria at low temperatures are also more reasonable now. The differences in equilibria involving the γ (austenite), α (ferrite), ε (hcp) and \{M3C\} (cementite) phases are very small. The improvement of carbide equilibria was possible by doing ab initio calculations of the enthalpies of formation of the metastable Fe3C, Fe23C6, Fe5C2 and Fe7C3 carbides. Calculations using the presently developed thermodynamic description are extensively compared with experimental data. },

  Review                   = {The distribution of nitrogen interstitials in binary Fe-N alloys has been studied using essentially M/Sssbauer spec- troscopy. Five iron environments Fij are detected in the 100 pet austenite obtained after quench at room temperature: Fo.o, I'o.,,,, Ft.o, Fl.m, F2.o, where i andj indicate the respective numbers of first- and second-nearest nitrogen neighbors of an iron atom. No ordering is concluded, contrary to the FesC structure in the Fe-C austenite, even though the dis- tribution is not random. Conversion electron Mrssbauer spectroscopy allows detection of a large concentration of inhomogeneity from the surface to the bulk as obtained from the gas-nitriding preparation far from equilibrium con- ditions. The distribution of interstitials seems random in the as- quenched martensite at 78 K. Iron atoms with no nitrogen in the first-nearest neighbor shell give rise to a hyperfine field distribution ( A , A2, A j) with values larger than 330 kOe due to the large strains. Iron atoms at the vertices of the octahedron surrounding an interstitial give two spectral components, B a and Be, with fields of about 325 and 300 kOe whether the Fe-N direction is perpendicular or parallel to the c-axis. Finally, a component C* with a field around 280 kOe corresponds to the possibility of having two ni- trogen neighbors probably in the N-Fe-N configuration along (110). A long-range ordering of nitrogen interstitials during the aging and tempering of martensite is followed by looking at the spectral changes. Four major stages are detected. 1. The formation of small coherent precipitates of a"- Fet6N2 characterized by a component A' with a field of about 360 kOe and an activation energy of 95 kJ/mole. 2. The thickening of the precipitates along [001]~, leading to semicoherent precipitates of ot"-Fel6N2 characterized by a component A" with a field of about 400 kOe and an ac- tivation energy of 126 k J/mole. 3. The disappearance of cd'-Fe~6N2 nitride and the forma- tion of TLFe4N with an activation energy of 94 kJ/mole. 4. The decomposition of retained austenite into y'-Fe4N and ferrite, which constitutes the stage of tempering. The environments A' and A" with fields of about 360 and 400 kOe are attributed to iron atoms of the ordered phase which have no nitrogen first-nearest neighbor but four sec- ond-nearest neighbors. Bo and B,, environments are the same in the as-quenched and ordered martensites, and the fields differences (314 vs 325 and 290 vs 300 kOe) reflect only the difference in the temperatures of measurements (ambi- ent vs 78 K). The kinetics of ordering of the nitrogen interstitials leading to ol"-Fel6N2 can be compared to the clustering- ordering synergy leading to a Fe6C carbide before its in situ transformation into e-r/ carbide. [t3,WTl Three steps were observed from M6ssbauer spectra, o71 which corre- spond to activation energies of 74, 75, and 121.5 kJ/mole, respectively: 1. the clustering of carbon atoms which form isolated mul- tiplets; 2. the ordering of the multiplets which leads to the small carbide precipitates of average formula Fe6C and charac- terized by a tweedlike morphology within the martensite matrix; f~5~and 3. the formation of e-~/carbide from the transformation of Fe6C. The clustering and ordering steps are both controlled by the carbon diffusion in iron.V71 Finally, the remarkable magnetic and mechanical prop- erties of ot"-Fe~6Nz, which lead to an exceptional localized hyperfine field of 400 kOe in a ferrite matrix and corre- spond to an average iron moment at 0 K within the range 2.3 to 2.6 /xB according to Coey e t a/., [291 have already opened up a large technological interest in preparing such a phase, and this kinetics study should provide precious guideline.}

Good agreement was obtained between the experimental and numerical results in terms of carbon diffusion and hardness profiles. The Sysweld® numerical code was used to perform the simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A methodology to simulate paraequilibrium (PE) growth in multicomponent systems using the DIC- TRA (Diffusion-Controlled Transformation) software is presented. For any given multicomponent system containing substitutional and interstitial elements, the basic approach is to define a hypothetical element Z, whose thermodynamic and mobility parameters are expressed in terms of the weighted average (with respect to site fraction) of the thermodynamic parameters and mobilities of the substitu- tional alloying elements. This procedure facilitates the calculation of PE phase diagrams and the PE growth simulations directly in the Thermo-Calc and DICTRA software, respectively. The results of two distinct case studies in multicomponent alloys are presented. In the first example, we simulate the isothermal growth of PE cementite in an Fe-C-Co-Cr-Mo-Ni secondary hardening steel during tempering. This is of practical importance in modeling the carbide precipitation kinetics during secondary hardening. In the second example, we have presented the results of PE ferrite growth during continuous cooling from an intercritical temperature in an Fe-Al-C-Mn-Si low-alloy steel. This is of importance to the design of triple-phase steels containing an austenite that has optimum stability, to facilitate stress-induced transformation under dynamic loading. The results of both simula- tions are in good accord with experimental results. The model calculations do not consider any resistive or dissipative forces, such as the interfacial energy, strain energy, or solute drag, and, as a result, the interface velocities represent an upper limit under the available chemical driving force.},

  Abstract                 = {This chapter deals with the influence of a second element on the mechanical properties of crystals, mainly metals. The foreign atom is assumed to substitute for an atom of the matrix. Interstitial solubility is in general limited and a second phase forms easily; the mechanical properties of this type of alloys are fully discussed in ch. 25. (See, however, also § 2.4.2.) The observations to be described here were obtained mainly on single crystals. They are thus best suited for interpretation by means of dislocation theory (as presented in ch. 20). In the discussion of the mechanical properties of terminal solid solutions the reader is assumed to be familiar with the mechanical properties of pure metals (chs. 21/22) and with the structure of solid solutions (described in ch. 3). Solute atoms in some alloys occupy preferentially one sublattice, i.e., there is (short range) order. Another kind of non-random distribution of the component atoms may lead to the formation of precipitates (ch. 15) which greatly harden the alloy. A truly random distribution is certainly rare because of differences in atomic size, charge etc., which lead to attractive or repulsive interactions between solute atoms, precipitation or order. The dislocation is influenced by such inhomogeneities on a rather fine scale, determined by its interaction force with a “cluster” and the dislocation line tension. It is known that a dislocation is bent by a force f on its atomic length b to a minimum radius R = μb3/f where μ is the elastic shear modulus. In typical hardened alloys R = 100b is reached. },

  Abstract                 = {Since the Gibbs energy of formation of Cr23C\{6\}, Cr\{7\}C\{3\}, and Cr3C2 in the Cr-C system was modified in the recent assessment of the Cr-Ni-C system, it is not possible to continue with the previous description of the Fe-Cr-C system. In the present work, the Fe-Cr-Ni-C system was studied thermodynamically together with the Fe-Cr-C system, using the new descriptions of the Cr-Ni-C, Fe-Ni-C, and Fe-Cr-Ni systems. The descriptions of M23C6, M\{7\}C\{3\}, body-centered cubic (bcc) ferrite, cementite, and liquid in the Fe-Cr-C system were reassessed. Particularly, attention was paid to improve the description of the solubility of M23C6 in face-centered cubic (fcc) austenite. Composition-dependent interactions for M23C6 and M7C3 were introduced in order to get good agreement. After the new assessment, comparisons between experimental information and calculated results were made, which show that the agreement with experiments is satisfactory. Some phase diagrams are presented for practical use.},

  Abstract                 = {SUNDIALS is a suite of advanced computational codes for solving large-scale problems that can be modeled as a system of nonlinear algebraic equations, or as initial-value problems in ordinary differential or differential-algebraic equations. The basic versions of these codes are called KINSOL, CVODE, and IDA, respectively. The codes are written in ANSI standard C and are suitable for either serial or parallel machine environments. Common and notable features of these codes include: inexact Newton-Krylov methods for solving large-scale nonlinear systems; linear multistep methods for time-dependent problems; a highly modular structure to allow incorporation of different preconditioning and/or linear solver methods; and clear interfaces allowing for users to provide their own data structures underneath the solvers. We describe the current capabilities of the codes, along with some of the algorithms and heuristics used to achieve efficiency and robustness. We also describe how the codes stem from previous and widely used Fortran 77 solvers, and how the codes have been augmented with forward and adjoint methods for carrying out first-order sensitivity analysis with respect to model parameters or initial conditions.}

  Abstract                 = {Four commercial steels with carbon contents in the range 0.1–0.5 wt.% have been examined in the as-quenched condition using electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and atom probe tomography. The austenite had been deformed 0%, 10% and 30% prior to brine quenching. No influence of this deformation was evident on the martensite hardness or in any of the microstructure measurements. Increasing carbon content showed a well-known marked effect on the hardness but resulted in little refinement in the grain structure of the martensite. All crystal structures were cubic; no evidence of tetragonality was seen even at the highest carbon level but some systematic changes in grain boundary misorientations existed. The content of carbon in true interstitial solid solution deduced from X-ray line shifts was small (∼0.02 wt.%), and was independent of the total carbon content in the steel. Atom probe tomography showed that carbon was almost completely segregated to lath boundaries and dislocations but with an increasing density of segregates in the higher carbon steels. Calculations of diffusion distances confirmed that the segregation patterns were compatible with autotempering of the martensite during quenching. Analysis of different possible contributions to strength leads to the conclusion that segregated carbon atoms at defects behave similarly to carbon in true solid solution and that this is the largest single factor controlling the strength of as-quenched martensite.},

Surprisingly, there is no influence of prior austenite deformation up to 30% on the hardness or on any of the microstructures observed. Crystal structures of these lath martensites are cubic in all cases. The amount of carbon existing in solid solution, as determined from X-ray line shifts, is very small ($0.02 wt.%) and is independent of the total carbon content of the steel. Autotempering during quenching is shown to be capable of redistributing the car- bon atoms into segregates at lath boundaries and intra-lath dislocations, in agreement with direct observations using APT. The base strength of the iron matrix together with observable structures such as grain size and dislocation density account for less that half of the measured strength of the martensite. The largest contribution to strengthening comes from the segregated carbon atoms, which are deduced to have the same influence as carbon atoms in true interstitial solid solution or possibly an even greater effect.}

SUMMARY The sensitivity of the 57Fe M6ssbauer effect to variations in the local environment of the target iron atom has led to its use in the investigation of the tempering process in martensitic steels. M6ssbauer spectroscopy has provided a powerful means for monitoring the onset and kinetics of the structural changes which occur during tempering. In addition, it has served as a valuable tool in the determina- tion of the iron atom-interstitial atom configurations within these structures. M6ssbauer effect studies of virgin Fe-C martensite indi- cate that carbon atoms predominantly occupy octahedral interstitial sites. At least three nonequivalent iron atom en- vironments have been observed. However, a disagreement exists as to the exact definition of these environments, the nature of the solid solution of carbon in iron, and the distri- bution of carbon atoms between octahedral and tetrahedral interstitial sites. Although there is a general consensus that carbon atoms agglomerate to regions of high carbon content when virgin martensite is aged at room temperature, the structure of these regions is also debated. One school of thought has a fraction of the carbon atoms jumping from tetrahedral interstices during the agglomeration process. Another involves the formation of ordered FeaC regions. These disagreements remain unresolved. The M6ssbauer spectra of e (or "q), X and 0-carbides were first recorded from synthesized samples or samples ex- tracted from tempered steels. These techniques permitted independent identification of the carbide structure and ac- curate determination of the M6ssbauer hyperfine param- eters. The spectra of the iron carbides were also recorded in situ, that is, within the martensite matrix from which they were precipitated. The temperatures at which each carbide is formed and the hyperfine parameters defining its spectrum were found to vary appreciably with alloy composition. Although Fe-N martensite has not been as widely studied as its Fe-C counterpart, this system appears fairly well de- fined. Nitrogen atoms in virgin Fe-N martensite occupy octahedral interstitial sites in a random manner. Nonequivalent iron atom environments associated with iron atoms which are the first, second, and third nearest neighbors of a nitro- gen atom have been identified. At room temperature, nitrogen atoms were observed to agglomerate by forming regions of ordered FemN2 within the body centered tetrag- onal martensitic structure. Further aging at 100 ~ leads to the precipitation of a"-Fel6N2. At 160 ~ "y'-Fe4N is ob- served to precipitate.}

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews the strengthening mechanisms associated with the various components of martensitic microstructures in steels and other ferrous alloys. The first section examines the experiments and strengthening theories associated with Fe–Ni and Fe–Ni–C alloys, in which the martensite, because of subzero Ms temperatures, can be evaluated with carbon atoms trapped in octahedral interstitial sites. The evaluation of strengthening in these alloys has been limited to interpreting yield strength of unaged, untempered martensite in terms of interstitial solid solution strengthening. The second section reviews strengthening of martensitic Fe–C alloys and low-alloy carbon steels with above-room-temperature Ms temperatures. In these alloys, it is impossible to prevent C diffusion during quenching, and strengthening of martensite becomes dependent on static and dynamic strain aging due to carbon atom interaction with dislocation substructure. In all alloys the dominant strengthening component of martensitic microstructures is the matrix of martensitic crystals, either in lath or plate morphology, but secondary effects due to other microstructural components such as carbides and retained austenite are also discussed. },

  Review                   = {5. Summary The above review shows that many factors influence the strength of martensitic microstructures in steels and other ferrous alloys. While martensitic microstructures are complex, consisting of retained austenite and sev- eral possible levels of carbide distributions, in addition to martensite crystals of several morphologies, never- theless it is the martensite which dominates perfor- mance. In the martensite crystals, the role that carbon atoms plays is varied, ranging from interstitial solid solution strengthening to segregation to dynamic strain aging, depending on whether or not carbon mobility can be suppressed during martensite formation and testing. The very high hardness of martensitic mi- crostructures, and very high ultimate strengths if brittle fracture can be avoided, are very much a function of the dynamic interactions which lead to high rates of strain hardening during deformation. The atomic and substructural obstacles to dislocation motion in marten- site are not fully characterized and require more re- search to provide deeper understanding of martensite deformation, mechanical properties, and fracture for future demanding structural applications.}

Mechanisms of the austenite to martensite transformation are considered, which can explain the formation of martensite with differentc/a for the same carbon content in the initial austenite. Occurrence of (011)m transformation twins explains both a lowering ofc/a and an orthorhombic distortion of the martensite lattice. It follows from analysis of the experimental results that the well known dependence of martensite lattice parameters and axial ratio on the carbon content relate to a partly disordered distribution of carbon atoms between three sublattices of the octahedral interstitial sites (ois). Using new values of the concentration coefficients of linear expansion of the martensite lattice, calculated for the case of carbon atoms distribution only in a single sublattice of the ois, leads to some corrections of the previous temperature and concentration dependences of order-disorder processes in martensite. Phenomena such as the reversible change of axial ratio due to the redistribution of carbon atoms between their normal positions and ``traps'' in irradiated martensite are described.},

  Abstract                 = {The algorithm of directed relation graph recently developed for skeletal mechanism reduction was extended to overall linear time operation, thereby greatly facilitating the computational effort in mechanism reduction, particularly for those involving large mechanisms. Together with a two-stage reduction strategy and using the kinetic responses of autoignition and perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) with extensive parametric variations as the criteria in eliminating unimportant species, a detailed 561-species n-heptane mechanism and a detailed 857-species iso-octane mechanism were successfully reduced to skeletal mechanisms consisting of 188 and 233 species, respectively. These skeletal mechanisms were demonstrated to mimic well the performance of the detailed mechanisms, not only for the autoignition and PSR systems based on which the reduced mechanisms were developed but also for the independent system of jet-stirred reactor. It was further observed that the accuracy of calculated species concentrations was equivalently bounded by the user-specified error threshold value and that the reduction time for a single reaction state is only about 50 ms for the large iso-octane mechanism. },

It was found that the existence of quasi-steady-state species induces no additional restriction on the application of DRG. When there are partial equilibrium reactions, DRG requires reactions with fast forward or backward rates to be reversible and the backward rate to be computed through the equilibrium constant. The effect of loss of significant digits in the evaluation of species relations due to substantial cancellation between the forward and backward rates of partial equilibrium reactions was identified and a criterion for minimum accuracy in sampled reaction states for DRG reduction was identified. The method of DRG was then compared with two methods recently developed for skeletal reduction: one is based on computational singular perturbation (CSP) and another is the directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP). Advantages and restrictions of including fast–slow subspace separation in skeletal reduction and the validity of the geometric error propagation model in DRGEP were discussed, with examples in the existence of exhausted fast processes.},

  Abstract                 = {A systematic approach for mechanism reduction was developed and demonstrated. The approach consists of the generation of skeletal mechanisms from detailed mechanism using directed relation graph with specified accuracy requirement, and the subsequent generation of reduced mechanisms from the skeletal mechanisms using computational singular perturbation based on the assumption of quasi-steady-state species. Both stages of generation are guided by the performance of \{PSR\} for high-temperature chemistry and auto-ignition delay for low- to moderately high-temperature chemistry. The demonstration was performed for a detailed ethylene oxidation mechanism consisting of 70 species and 463 elementary reactions, resulting in a specific skeletal mechanism consisting of 33 species and 205 elementary reactions, and a specific reduced mechanism consisting of 20 species and 16 global reactions. Calculations for laminar flame speeds and nonpremixed counterflow ignition using either the skeletal mechanism or the reduced mechanism show very close agreement with those obtained by using the detailed mechanism over wide parametric ranges of pressure, temperature, and equivalence ratio. },

  Abstract                 = {A powerful method for the analysis of solid-state transformation kinetics can be based on non- isothermal analysis where the temperature corresponding to a fixed stage of transformation is mea- sured as a function of heating rate. Adoption of a specific kinetic model is not required for valid application of this method. This removes constraints imposed unnecessarily on so-called Kissinger- like procedures. The method was applied to study and to compare the tempering kinetics of iron- carbon martensite and iron-nitrogen martensite (about 1.1 wt pct interstitials). Dilatometry and differential scanning calorimetry were employed. This combination of experimental techniques allowed distinction between preprecipitation processes as segregation and clustering of interstitials. In contrast with iron-carbon martensite, no indications were obtained for clustering of interstitials in iron-nitrogen martensite. The preprecipitation stages have activation energies of 75 to 85 kJ/mole, which are ascribed to volume diffusion of interstitials. The precipitation of the transition carbide/ nitride (first stage of tempering) occurs with an activation energy of 110 to 125 kJ/mole, which is ascribed to pipe diffusion of iron. The precipitation of the equilibrium carbide/nitride (third stage of tempering) is associated with an activation energy of 195 to 205 kJ/mole which is ascribed to combined pipe and volume diffusion of iron.},

  Review                   = {A. Analysis of Transformation Kinetics 1. In the case of nonisothermal annealing the activation energy governing the transformation can be determined from the slope of the straight line obtained by plotting ln(T2i,/qb) vs 1/Ti, where T and • denote the tempera- ture corresponding to the stage of transformation f ' and the heating rate, respectively. 2. It can be shown that in the above procedure the non- trivial replacement of Tj, by T~, the temperature corre- sponding to an inflection point on the curve o f f v s T(~t) (i.e., the temperature where the reaction rate is maxi- mal), is justified. This eliminates the constraints inher- ent to specification of assumed kinetic reaction models for all "Kissinger-like" analyses published so far, there- by providing a general basis (Eqs. [2] and [15]).
B. Kinetics of Tempering of lron-Carbon and Iron- Nitrogen Martensites 1. Preprecipitation (a) Iron-carbon Segregation of carbon leads to a decrease of specific volume whereas clustering does not. Both processes are accompanied by a release of heat. Segregation is completed much sooner than clustering. Both pro- cesses are controlled by volume diffusion of carbon. (b) Iron-nitrogen Segregation of nitrogen atoms occurs with kinetics comparable to those found for iron-carbon. No indi- cation of clustering was obtained; as compared to iron-carbon a less pronounced heat production oc- curs at higher temperatures. This heat production is ascribed to precipitation of coherent c~" nitrides. 2. First stage of tempering Precipitation of transition carbide (e/~)/nitride (~") leads to pronounced heat production, in conjunction with a significant decrease of specific volume for iron-carbon in contrast to a very small increase of specific volume for iron-nitrogen. For both martensites about the same activation energy is found, that suggests rate control by pipe diffusion of iron atoms. 3. Third stage of tempering Precipitation of the "equilibrium" carbide (0)/nitride (y ') leads to a significant decrease of specific volume, where- as the heat effects are obscured by that corresponding to the decomposition of retained austenite (second stage of tempering). For both martensites about the same acti- vation energy is found that suggests rate control by mu- tually nonnegligible contributions of pipe and volume diffusion of iron atoms.}

  Abstract                 = {Alternative chemical reaction pathways leading to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the pyrolysis of unsaturated light hydrocarbons were investigated to extend the previously proposed chemical kinetic model [K. Norinaga, O. Deutschmann, Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 46 (2007) 3547–3557]. Although the previous model provided a reasonably good description of the pyrolysis behaviors observed in flow reactor experiments at 1073–1373&\#xa0;K, the concentration profiles for large \{PAHs\} were underestimated significantly. In this study, pyrolysates from ethylene, acetylene, and propylene were analyzed in detail using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) to find the intermediates that are believed to be crucial for \{PAH\} formation. Based on the newly identified products, reaction schemes for aromatic growth via 1,2-diphenylethylene, 1,2-diphenylacetylene, triphenylene, and benz[f]indene were proposed and added to the previous model. The predictive capabilities improved slightly simply because of the minority of the newly found compounds. The addition of reaction schemes for self-combination of indenyl radicals to form benz[a]anthracene and chrysene had a significant effect, and were found to be necessary to account for the formation of large \{PAHs\} such as benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and benz[a]pyrene. Results from reaction flux analysis to identify the likely chemical pathways important for \{PAH\} growth, as well as numerical simulations of the influence of acetone contamination on acetylene pyrolysis, are presented. },

The following main contributions to yield strength have been quantitatively distinguished: substitutional element solution hardening, packet boundaries (high-angle), lath boundaries (low-angle) and dislocations within laths. The contribution from martensite packets follows an ordinary Petch-Hall relation. In the Mn steels the Petch-Hall coefficient is found to be about the same as in ferritic carbon steels, but is strikingly lower in the 5 and 9% Ni steel. A fairly constant contribution of about 150 N/mm**2 is established for the martensite lath boundaries. The dislocation density within the laths is high and is consequently responsible for a significant part of the yield strength. The dislocation density is found to increase markedly with carbon content, which seems to be the apparent reason for the steep increase in yield strength with carbon content. When all these contributions are taken into account there remains no part of the yield strength which can be associated with any strong solid solution hardening from carbon. Thus quenched low-carbon lath martensite might be compared to a heavily cold-worked ferrite and an increase in carbon content in the martensite then is analogous to an increased degree of deformation.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a new tabulation strategy for the numerical integration of chemical reacting flow processes on the basis of a non-stiff system of equations. Both the tabulation and the identification of the non-stiff system are adaptive and are based on the Computational Singular Perturbation (CSP) method. The tabulation strategy is implemented in order to store and reuse the CSP quantities required for the construction of the non-stiff model. In this paper we describe a particular feature of this algorithm, the 'homogeneous correction', that allows for an accurate and efficient identification of the manifold on which the solution moves according to the slow time scales. The improved efficiency in constructing the slow model and simulating the system dynamics along the manifold during run-time calculations is demonstrated.}

  Abstract                 = {A number of numerical methods are used to solve the point kinetics equations in nuclear dynamics. However, the point kinetics equation is characterized by stiff nonlinear ordinary differential equations, which is a severe problem in numerical solution and results in the need for small time steps in a computational scheme. It is difficult to obtain accurate results. In this work we propose a numerical solution to the point kinetics equations. The proposed method is based on the matrix exponential method under the zero order hold (ZOH) assumption and includes the automatic correction of rounding errors. It is robust to stiff problems and suitable for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate performance, the results of the proposed method are compared with the expanded Taylor series method and the procedure is tested using various sampling times and input signals. },

Parumasur, Amplitude-Shape Method for the Numerical Solution of Ordinary Differential Equations, Ph.D. Thesis, Department of Mathematics, University of Natal, Durban, 1997; Quaestiones Math. 24 (2001) 69] for solving ordinary differential equations consisted in transforming certain systems of stiff ordinary differential equations into two subsystems consisting of a rapidly changing amplitude function and slowly varying shape vector, respectively. In this paper we consider a new formulation of the amplitude and shape equations, which is particularly well suited for certain classes of problems occurring in chemical kinetics. The resulting equations are treated with a partitioned method consisting of the Rosenbrock method and the trapezoidal rule. It is shown that the use of the proposed new version of the amplitude-shape method leads to a substantial gain in computational efficiency in comparison with the conventional implicit or semi-implicit schemes employed in stiff solvers.},

  Abstract                 = {Production rates obtained from a detailed chemical mechanism are analyzed in order to quantify the coupling between the various species and reactions involved. These interactions can be represented by a directed relation graph. A geometric error propagation strategy applied to this graph accurately identifies the dependencies of specified targets and creates a set of increasingly simplified kinetic schemes containing only the chemical paths deemed the most important for the targets. An integrity check is performed concurrently with the reduction process to avoid truncated chemical paths and mass accumulation in intermediate species. The quality of a given skeletal model is assessed through the magnitude of the errors introduced in the target predictions. The applied error evaluation is variable-dependent and unambiguous for unsteady problems. The technique yields overall monotonically increasing errors, and the smallest skeletal mechanism that satisfies a user-defined error tolerance over a selected domain of applicability is readily obtained. An additional module based on life-time analysis identifies a set of species that can be modeled accurately by quasi-steady state relations. An application of the reduction procedure is presented for autoignition using a large iso-octane mechanism. The whole process is automatic, is fast, has moderate CPU and memory requirements, and compares favorably to other existing techniques. },

A good agreement was obtained with iron foil analysis. Of even more practical importance is the computer model developed for the calculation of carbon and nitrogen profiles for lowalloyed steel after carburizing and carbonitriding. It is very flexible and can for instance handle multi-treatments like two-step boost and diffusion treatments, decarburization, and denitriding. The agreement is excellent in some cases and reasonable in others. As a necessary part, simple relations for the interaction between carbon and nitrogen in austenite, based on the geometric exclusion model, have been developed. Based on this model and a literature study, expressions for the carbon and nitro- gen diffusion coefficients, including the dependence on the carbon and nitrogen concentration, have been derived. A method to treat the interaction between alloying elements and carbon and nitrogen in steel has been chosen from the literature.}

  Abstract                 = {The Monte Carlo computer simulation of the f.c.c. Fe–N alloy is performed using the data of abundances of different iron sites in the austenite lattice as obtained by means of Mössbauer spectroscopy. The validity of the interpretations of available Mössbauer spectra was tested based on the data of calculation of N–N interaction energies in the two first coordination spheres on the interstitial sublattice, which could satisfy the experimental data of nitrogen distribution in austenite derived from Mössbauer spectra. It is shown that no values of N–N interaction energies exist that could be consistent with the data of conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS), where a thin surface layer only contributes to the Mössbauer spectra. A strong N–N repulsion (&gt;0.14 eV) in the first coordination sphere and a soft N–N repulsion (&lt;0.07 eV) in the second one was found to be consistent with the studies performed by means of transmission Mössbauer spectroscopy (TMS), according to which single nitrogen atoms and 180° N–N pairs exist in the nitrogen austenite. A possibility of the long-range order-like Fe4N is shown at the energy values determined for two coordination spheres, provided a small N–N repulsion in the third coordination sphere occurs. It is also observed that the available data of nitrogen activity in Fe–N austenite are not consistent with the values of N–N interaction energies determined from the analysis of Mössbauer spectra, i.e. the available activity data do not correspond to the nitrogen distribution in the iron austenite as it follows from Mössbauer data. The concentration dependence of nitrogen activity and an effect of the \{N2\} gas pressure on the nitrogen solubility in Fe–N austenite are calculated using the values of N–N interaction energies in two coordination spheres. },

The values of the carbon activity in FeC austenite were also derived from C-C interaction parameters and compared with the experimental data available, which, in turn, allowed one to test the existing interpretations of the Mössbauer spectra of FeC austenite. It was shown that the concentration dependence of the carbon activity at different temperatures can be successfully described only by taking into account C-C interactions in several coordination spheres: a weak repulsion in the first coordination sphere and a stronger one in the second sphere. This corresponds to the interpretation of Mössbauer spectra as consisting of the component of “pure” iron atoms, Fe0, iron atoms with one carbon atom as a nearest neighbour, Fe1, and iron atoms with paired carbon atoms in the neighbouring interstitial sites, Fe2–90. It is shown that superstructures like Fe4C1-x and Fe8C1-x proposed in some Mössbauer studies of FeC austenite could exist only at those combinations of C-C interaction parameters in the first, second and third coordination spheres which are not consistent with the values of the carbon activity. },

In particular, the possibility of lowering the gas consumption is investigated. A mathematical model which accounts for the carbon diffusion in the steel, the surface reactions on the steel, and the change in the furnace atmosphere composition caused by the carburizing reactions is developed. Two experimental series are performed in order to investigate the dependence of the final carbon profile, the atmosphere composition, etc. on the gas exchange rate. Both experiments and calculations reveal that it is possible to decrease the gas exchange rate considerably and thus the gas consumption compared to what is usually applied. At very low exchange rates an increased CH4 content is observed. Possible drawbacks of this increase are discussed, such as the increased risk for sooting, etc.},

The theoretical studies are based on computer simulations of the carbon diffusion, the surface reactions, and the reactions in the furnace atmosphere. Special attention has been paid to the effect of lowering the gas exchange rate. The experimental results show that the result of the carburizing does not depend very much on the gas exchange rate. Both the experimental results and the theoretical calculations show that the most important effect o f lowering the gas exchange rate is that the atmosphere is displaced from equilibrium. This is manifested in a much higher methane content than at equilibrium. It is suggested that a high methane content may be partly responsible for problems reported in connection with nonequilibrium atmospheres such as sooting.}

  Abstract                 = {Thirty-nine detailed mechanisms for combustion of hydrogen, carbon monoxide and methanol are investigated using ReactionKinetics, a Mathematica based package published earlier. Our methods involved mainly structural and graph theoretical approaches as well as techniques which are related to the time evolution of the considered mechanisms. Our investigations support the view that the hydrogen mechanisms tend to take on a final form in these days. CO combustion mechanisms, however, showed a larger variety both in species and in reaction steps. There exist only a few mechanisms directly developed to describe methanol combustion (mechanisms developed for other purposes may contain a submechanism for methanol combustion); the big differences between them shows that the modeling community is only at the very beginning of exploring this process. Most of our results do not depend on the choice of reaction rate coefficients, the methods only use the underlying sets of reaction steps, hence they are robust and general. These investigations can be used before or in parallel with usual numerical investigations, such as pathway analysis, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation or simulation. The package and the methods may be useful for automatic mechanism generations, testing, comparing and reduction of mechanisms as well, especially in the case of large systems.},

  Abstract                 = {The precipitation of ␣" iron nitride in FeN martensite (containing about 5.9 N/100 Fe) is studied as a function of tempering time successively at 333 and 373 K by means of X-ray diffractometry (XRD). On the basis of peak (ϭlattice parameter) shifts and intensity changes of main and superstructure reflections, it is concluded that, during tempering, the structure of the formed ␣" precipitates changes. At 333 K, initially stoichiometric Fe16N2 is formed and, with further tempering, structural vacancies are introduced, i.e., Fe16N2Ϫx is formed. At 373 K, the vacancies are partially filled. The change of the ␣" structure at 333 K is caused by the change of the matrix from martensite to ferrite, i.e., the misfit between the ␣" and the matrix is initially relatively small and then increases. By allowing nitrogen-deficient ␣", the increase of the misfit can be diminished at the expense of some increase of the volume of ␣". Gibbs free energy calculations (at 333 K), in which differences in the misfit energy are decisive, indeed show that, in a martensite matrix, Fe16N2 is favored, whereas, in a ferrite matrix, Fe16N2Ϫx is favored. Further, in this article, methods are presented to calculate structure factors for nitrogen-deficient ␣" and to obtain, from measured (ϭstrained) lattice parameters, strain-free ␣" lattice parameters from which the composition can be deduced.},

  Review                   = {Tempering at 333 K of an FeN martensite (with an in- terstitial content of 5.9N/100Fe) leads to precipitation of the ␣" transition nitride. In the very first stage of ␣" pre- cipitation, where the matrix is practically martensite, the precipitates consist of perfect Fe16N2. Upon prolonged tem- pering at this temperature, where the matrix becomes fer- ritic, the precipitates consist of nitrogen-deficient Fe16N2Ϫx, such that structural vacancies are introduced on the nitrogen sublattice. After tempering at 333 K for 110 hours, the (strained) c lattice parameter of ␣" is 0.621 nm (the nitro- gen content is X␣ " ϭ 10.75 and the displacements of the Fe atoms are ⌬z ϭ 0.039 and ⌬x ϭ 0.0028). Analysis of Gibbs free energy changes shows, in the case of elastic accommodation of the volume misfit between the ␣" particles and the matrix, that (1) in a martensite matrix, perfect ␣" nitride is favored over nitrogen-deficient ␣" ni- tride and that (2) in a ferrite matrix, nitrogen-deficient ␣" nitride is favored over perfect ␣" nitride. For (1), the dif- ferences in the ordering energy are decisive, whereas, for (2), the differences in misfit energy are decisive. Subse- quent tempering at 373 K leads to filling of nitrogen va- cancies due to small energy contributions caused by periodic arrangement of the precipitates. The c lattice parameter of unstrained perfect ␣"-Fe16N2 is predicted to be 0.6338 nm; on this basis, the c lattice param- eter of perfect ␣"-Fe16N2 confined in a ferrite matrix is cal- culated to be 0.6287 nm. The experimental value is 0.6283 nm (the nitrogen content is X␣ " ϭ 12.45 and the displace- ments of the Fe atoms are ⌬z ϭ 0.047 and ⌬x ϭ 0.0034).

The orientation relation between austenite and martensite, the habit plane and types of (post-) transformation twins were determined. Tempering-induced changes in hardness and release of heat were related to structural changes as revealed by electron diffraction. Differences with analogous iron-carbon martensites were discussed. Aging at room temperature leads to nitrogen diffusion- controlled precipitation of coherent ~"-Fel6N2 platelets, which process is completed after about one day.

  Review                   = {V. CONCLUSIONS A. Crystallography 1. Small orientation differences are usual between adjacent laths in a packet. Large orientation differences also oc- cur. In the latter case adjacent laths have a common (011)4, axis. 2. The habit plane of lath martensite is {232}r. 3. The Nishiyama-Wassermann orientation relationship holds approximately for austenite and high-nitrogen plate martensite. 4. {ll2}~,-transformation twins and {011}~,- and {011}~ post-transformation twins occur in plate martensite. 5. The habit plane of high-nitrogen plate martensite is {259}r, in agreement with theoretical prediction.
B. Tempering 1. Aging at room temperature leads to precipitation of coherent a"-Fe16N2 platelets. This is accompanied by an increase in hardness and a release of heat. No evidence for clustering as a preprecipitation stage for a"-nitride was obtained. 2. Precipitation of a"-nitride at room temperature is nearly completed after one day of aging. Kinetic analysis shows that the precipitation process involves nitrogen diffusion- controlled growth of homogeneously nucleated platelets. 3. Aging at 403 K and 463 K leads to precipitation of incoherent ~"-FeI6N2 platelets. This is accompanied by a decrease in hardness and a release of heat. 4. Only one variant of the {001},, habit plane is used for a"-precipitation. 5. Aging at 463 K leads to a"-platelets each of which can be partly parallel to a habit plane deviating about 18 deg from {001}5,. This can be due to a misfit-stress effect dependent on the aspect ratio of the platelet.}

  Abstract                 = {Abstract High temperature carburization is becoming more and more attractive because it can remarkably reduce processing time and increase productivity. However, the commonly used gear steels which are microalloyed by Al are not suitable for high temperature carburization due to abnormal grain coarsening. The gear steel 20CrMnTiNb, which is microalloyed with 0. 048% Nb and 0. 038% Ti, has been compared with the gear steel 20CrMn in terms of microstructure in the case of hardened layer and in the core after carburizing at 1000 °C for 4 h and mechanical properties after carburizing and pseudo-carburizing. The results indicate that the fine austenite grains exist in the carburized case of 20CrMnTiNb steel, while there is abnormal coarsening and duplex grain structure in the case and core of steel 20CrMn. The average prior austenite grain sizes are 19.5 and 34.2 μm for the steels 20CrMnTiNb and 20CrMn, respectively. In addition, the mechanical properties of 20CrMnTiNb steel are superior to those of 20CrMn steel. In particular, the \{HV\} hardness of the former is higher than that of the latter by about 40–70 in the range of less than 0.7 mm in depth. Therefore, the steel 20CrMnTiNb is suitable for high temperature carburization.},
