# Analysis of acetylene pyrolysis

Analysis of acetylene kinetics under conditions relevant to gas carburizing. The study is conducted with a DRG skeletal mechanism and comprise both PFR
1-D simulations and 3-D CFD cases. All cases are validated experimentally and data is made available for verification.

## To-do's

- [ ] Validate new release of PFR model with wall temperature / simulate.
- [ ] Migrate FOAM case preparation from Python to Julia (*majordome*).
- [ ] Run FOAM mesh convergence/simulations and extract results.
- [ ] Add Graf (2007) as a baseline comparison to paper.
- [ ] Export mechanism with pyJac and benchmark in FOAM.
- [ ] Finish paper text and publish.
